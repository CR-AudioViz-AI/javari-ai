# SECTION 6: AI ROUTING & COST MODEL

## Smart Routing Architecture
```
User Request → Javari Router → Classify Complexity → Route to Best AI

Simple (greetings, FAQ)     → Claude Haiku    ($0.014/min, 97% margin)
Medium (explain, summarize) → GPT-4o-mini    ($0.008/min, 98% margin)
Complex (code, strategy)    → Claude Sonnet  ($0.165/min, 67% margin)
Search (current events)     → Perplexity     ($0.020/min, 96% margin)
```

## Cost Tracking Required
Every AI call must log:
- Timestamp
- User ID
- Model used
- Input tokens
- Output tokens
- Cost calculated
- Response time
